<p class="lead">
  Towards the end of my collegiate experience, I reflected on the next steps I would take in my life to lead towards a fulfilling career. I have always had passion for design, and after conducting research I decided the next step towards achieving my dream of designing was to jet off to Milan to take classes in leather goods patternmaking, design, and product production.

<p class="lead">
	My intent in traveling to Milan was to pursue my passion for handbag design, however, the interior design of the hotel I resided in detracted me from handbags and led me headfirst into launching an interior decor brand. My hotel, the Excelsior Milano evokes the most beautiful and exquisite interior tastes - from the creamy velvet curtains, to the leather wrapped coffee bar, to the waterfall chandelier dangling down multiple staircases. The interior design of this hotel lit the passion in me to create an interior decor company that allows women and men to have sophisticated, glamorous homes as lovely as the Excelsior. My dream of producing luxurious bedding collections, dining pieces, home fragrance, and home accents is the greatest motivation I have to push myself beyond any detours and limitations I am presented by as a businesswoman.
